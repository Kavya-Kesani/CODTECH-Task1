**Planning and Design :** Define the scope and features of the to-do application.
**Setting up the Development Environment:** Set up a version control system(e.g., Git) for tracking changes.
**HTML Structure:** Develop the basic HTML structure for the application of to-do list.
**CSS Styling:** Apply Styles to the HTML structure to clean and neat responsive design.
